# Dog Finder

## Description
Dog finder is a fun way to view photos of various dogs, and learn about their breeds & sub-breeds.  Users load a random image of a dog, provided by the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/), and click the Breed or Sub-breed button to see their information.  Users can choose their favorite dog and navigate to the favorites tab to see a table view of their dogs and breeds. Utilizes CoreData to persist photo data on device, UIKit, UITableView, & Fetch Requests. 

This app is my capstone project for Udacity's [iOS Nanodegree Program](https://udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd003).  

## Usage
* No pre-work needed.  Just build and run (use Master branch).
* Upon launch, click the reload button to show a random dog photo.
* Click the Breed or Sub-breed button to view information about the current dog photo.
* Add current dog to a list of favorites by clicking the heart shaped button.
* Click the "Favorites" tab to view a table collection of favorited dogs.
